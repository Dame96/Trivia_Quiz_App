Hey Team! Welcome Back to Designs With Dame!

 - I developed this project to provide a easy and interactive UI for users to test their Genius! (Don't worry, if you answer wrong you can try again!)

 - This project allows users to interact with the Open Trivia DB API to generate random questions from various categories and test their knowledge. While developing this project I learned how to effectively utilize state and props to managage the changing state of the the components within the UI.  

- To Develop this project I utilized React + Vite, and JSX to develop my functional components that are used to render the the UI. 

- To Install and Run the Project: 
1. Clone the Repo 
2. "npm install" to install the dependencies 
3. "npm run" to run the project! 

Once the Project Displays in the browser, follow the instructions listed to generate your first question and enjoy!
